    "input": "(A) Network covalent\n(B) Ionic\n(C) Metallic\n(D) Molecular",
    "output": "Because the melting point is extremely high and does not conduct electricity as a solid nor a liquid, it is a covalent network substance. Covalent network substances have strong bonds which are hard to break, and due to their molecular nature never conduct electricity. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

    "instruction": "Does butanal, pentane, or propanoic acid have the highest boiling point, and why?\nAnswer format: A/B/C/D",
    "input": "(A) Butanal, because it can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds\n(B) Pentane, because it has the longest carbon chain\n(C) Pentane, because it has the most C−H bonds\n(D) Propanoic acid, because it can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds",
    "output": "If a molecule has hydrogen bonds, it has the largest boiling points since the intermolecular attractions of hydrogen bonds are extremely high. Propanoic has hydrogen bonds due to its COOH group, and neither pentane nor butanal have it. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",

    "output": "The solution in the second vessel can't be KCl because it has twice as many negative ions as positive ions. This fits the description of CaCl2, because CaCl2 has 2 negative ions for every 1 positive ion. Additionally, the molarity has to be twice that of vessel 1.

    "output": "A is incorrect because the ionization energy of Al is actually less than that of B, since Al is much larger and as such doesn't have as tight a hold on its electrons. B is incorrect because ionization energy is not caused by electronegativity. C is incorrect because the atomic radius of Ca is larger due to the fact that there are more electrons which take up more space in higher energy levels, not because of shielding. D is correct as Cl is smaller than S due to its higher nuclear charge which pulls the electrons in tighter. The correct answer is D.",

    "output": "When the temperature decreases slightly from 273 K to 220 K, the volume must also decrease slightly to keep everything else constant. When the pressure decreases significantly from 1 atm to 0.1 atm, the volume must increase significantly to keep everything else constant.
