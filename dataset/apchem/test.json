    "output": "A is incorrect because the ionization energy of Al is actually less than that of B, since Al is much larger and as such doesn't have as tight a hold on its electrons. B is incorrect because ionization energy is not caused by electronegativity. C is incorrect because the atomic radius of Ca is larger due to the fact that there are more electrons which take up more space in higher energy levels, not because of shielding. D is correct as Cl is smaller than S due to its higher nuclear charge which pulls the electrons in tighter. The correct answer is D.",

    "output": "When the temperature decreases slightly from 273 K to 220 K, the volume must also decrease slightly to keep everything else constant. When the pressure decreases significantly from 1 atm to 0.1 atm, the volume must increase significantly to keep everything else constant.
